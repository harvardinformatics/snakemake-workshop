# Introduction to Snakemake

{{ author_row(page) }}

This is a two session workshop intended to introduce analysts to the workflow scripting language Snakemake. Workflow management systems, such as Snakemake, allow one to create reproducible and scalable data analysis pipelines. In the first session, we will cover the basics of **running** a Snakemake workflow. In the second session, we'll learn the basics of **writing and developing** a Snakemake workflow from scratch. This will aid those who wish to convert their analyses to workflows.

While we do not require attendees to have previous experience writing Snakemake scripts, this is an intermediate level workshop, so some computational experience is required:

- Basic knowledge of navigating a file system from the command line
- Previous experience with command line software and ability to read basic bash scripts
- Basic understanding software environments (*e.g.* conda) and containers (*e.g.* singularity)

!!! important "Cluster account required"

    Additionally, since this workshop will involve exercises on the Cannon cluster, a [Cannon account through FASRC is required](https://docs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/kb/quickstart-guide/).
